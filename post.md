# From Monolith to Modern: Evolving the Architecture 

Remember that simple paycheck planning app? Let's talk about how it grew up.
Initial setup worked, but had clear limitations:

Every change meant SSH-ing into EC2
Frontend and backend tightly coupled on one instance
Local SQLite database limited scalability
Manual SSL certificate management

Enter the upgrade:
Distributed the components:

Frontend → S3 + CloudFront (static hosting)

Better performance
Reduced EC2 costs
Edge caching out of the box

Backend → Containerized FastAPI on EC2

Cleaner deployment
Better resource isolation
Easier local development

The game-changer: SQLite → MongoDB Atlas

From "it works on my machine" to proper DB management
Automated backups
Better scaling capabilities
No more worrying about disk space

SSL handling? Moved to AWS Certificate Manager:

Auto-renewal
CloudFront integration
No more late-night certificate expiration panics

Real talk: Was this overkill for a personal budget app? Maybe. But it taught me invaluable lessons about cloud architecture, managed services, and system design.
